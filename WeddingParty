Dear Wedding Party,

If you are reading this than you have exclusive access to this top secret web archive. Deron and I are extremely thankful that you

As you have travelled with us through tough trials and tribulations, we know that we have you for the long haul and as we embark on
our journey as husbands we will assuredly still need you. Thanks in advance for being there for us! We love you.
